# Research question


* Part descriptive:
  + How does the Russian legal system handle election-manipulation cases?
  
* Part broadly theoretical:
  + Does legal risk influence future election manipulation?
  
---

# Preliminary findings

* **How does the Russian legal system handle election-manipulation cases?**
  + Routinely addresses election-manipulation issues through 2016
  + Convictions very common
  + Number of cases drops off dramatically after 2016
  
* **Does legal risk influence future election manipulation?**
  + Major sentences associated with reduced fraud in next election
  
---

# Overview of literature

* Non-democracies have reasons to maintain a degree of judicial independence (Moustafa 2008, Whiting 2017, Ginsburg 2008, Rios-Figueroa 2018, Staton 2020)  -Update these with correct authors
  + Legitimation
  + Monitoring
  + Low-level accountability

* In Russia
  + JP courts regularly rule against the state (Hendley 2017) 
  + General perception that the courts are fair (Hendley 2016)

* Nevertheless, lots of tools to intervene in specific cases (Ledeneva 2008, Llanos2016, Solomon2010, Popova 2012 Taylor 2014, Wang2020)

* This combination works for the system and elites, but creates **risk** for low-level agents

---

# Three views of courts and election manipulation

* Courts reveal information that may spark protest (Chernykh and Svolik 2015)

* Pressure in competitive elections increases manipulation (Popova 2012)

* Judicial system creates risks for agents (Harvey 2022), intensifying  principal-agent problems (Rundlett and Svolik 2016)

---

#Theory

* Election manipulation efforts entail principal-agent and coordination problems (Rjundlett and Svolik 2016)
* Agents weigh costs and benefits
  + Benefits: Patronage rewards (Hale 2014, Forrat 20xx)
  + Costs: Risk of exposure and punishment
  
* Agents can respond by shirking, or refusing certain kinds of manipulation (Harvey2019)

* Courts that impose penalties increase the risk of exposure and the cost

---

# Hypotheses

* H1: The application of a severe penalty for convicted election manipulators should be associated with reduced election fraud in the court's region in the subsequent election.


* H2: The application of a light penalty for convicted election manipulators should be associated with increased election fraud in the court's region in the subsequent election.

# Data

* Case decisions scraped from SudAct (sudact.ru), automatically coded by legal code and year

* Hand coded for region, outcome, initiator, target
  + Current cases only fully coded for 142.1 of the criminal code (falsification of results)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)

crim_descr <- read_csv(here("Data", "code_descriptions_crim.csv"), col_types = "cc") #Two columns, both character
admin_descr <- read_csv(here("Data", "code_descriptions_admin.csv"),  col_types = "cc")
case_metadata <- read.csv(here("Data", "case_metadata_142_1.csv"))
annual_data <- read.csv(here("annual_data.csv"))

##NOTE: Double-check article 142 cases--none show up on SudAct, yet we have some cases in the data here.

```

```{r allCases, fig.cap="All cases by year", out.width='90%', echo=FALSE}
ggdraw() + 
  draw_image("C:/Users/colej/Documents/Research projects/scrape_russian_courts/Plots/all_cases_plot.png", scale = .85, vjust = -0.25)
#Note to self: Re-do cases for 5.4--some kind of mix-up there--meaning, re-search and download them from sudact

# Statistical analysis

* OLS regression
* DV: Deviance from uniform of last-digit zeroes (Skovoroda and Lankina)
* EV based on sentences:
  + Major fine (> 50,000 rubles)
  + Prison time
  + "Major penalty" = 1 if either of the above = 1 
  + All take on a positive value only for the subsequent election in that region
* Controls:
  * Number of precincts per region
  * Number of defendants per region-year
  * Fixed effects by region and year
* Data:
  + 176 cases related to alleged falsification of results
  + Region-level deviance estimated from precinct-level election results (national elections 2011-2021)
  
---

# DV: Deviance from uniform of last-digit zeroes

$$Deviance_{0,i} = 2(O_{i0}log(\frac{O_{i0}}{0.1n_{i}}) + (n_{i} - O_{i0})log(\frac{(n_{i} - O_{i0})}{.9n_{i}}))$$
where, 

* $Deviance_{0,i}$ 

refers to the region-level deviance in last-digit zeroes,

* $O_{i0}$ indicates the total number of zeroes in the region, and

* $n_{i}$ refers to the number of polling places in the region

# Anecdotal qualitative evidence

* Organizers, higher-level perpetrators of fraud not held accountable
  + Only precinct election commissioners
* Prosecution appears more likely in regional and local elections
* Motives are usually obscured

"... out of greed and other personal interest, with a view to obtaining additional material payments by giving the [Territorial Election Commission] leadership a favorable impression of her organization and conduct of the elections, to ensure a high voter turnout on the day of his election, and to increase the results of voting for a party to which she is more sympathetic..."

---

# Conclusion

* More work is needed; specifically, more coding
  + Measurement bias a distinct possibility
  + Still, results suggest that risk of penalty does damage the machinery of manipulation
  
* Criminal justice system continues to operate even in a politically closed environment
  + Administrative cases appear constrained in Putin's 4th term--why?
  
* Clear there is a tension between the good of the system as a whole, and the good of individual agents
